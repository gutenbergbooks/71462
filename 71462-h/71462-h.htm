</div>


<p>This Series of Nature Readers is intended for the use of
beginners in reading. The subjects chosen, and their treatment,
have been alike subordinated to this object. The Nature Readers
are not offered as text-books in natural science, but rather as a
contribution to the idea that facts of real and permanent value,
may be made known, a noble taste may be cultivated, thought
may be developed, and the initiatory steps in an increasingly
popular study may be taken, while a child is learning to read a
certain number of English words.</p>

<p>Should not the first short, strong Saxon sentences be rather
used to convey scientific facts, than such trivial information as,
“The boy has a new hat,” or, “I had a plate of green corn to
eat, on the fourth day of July”?</p>

<p>Lessons fresh from the sea-shore and the field, where life is
seen, not in an abnormal state, as captivity, but in its own chosen
homes and natural development, cannot fail to have an educative
power of great value, even to minds of a very early age.</p>

<p>The real difficulty to be overcome has been to put these simple
lessons concerning the habits, homes, and anatomy of certain
animals, into such words as are usually found in the most elementary
reading-books. To accomplish this, so that the series shall
reach the hands for which it was intended, has been the author’s
chief concern. There is happily no uncertainty as to the scientific
accuracy of the work. Every substantive statement has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
verified by the observation of the author, or of those whose competency
for such work is unquestioned. The practical value of
this series of Nature Readers must now be tried in the Homes and
the Schools.</p>

<p>Whether the pages have been discreetly broken into paragraphs
to catch restless and unaccustomed eyes, whether the words and
subjects have been fitly chosen, whether the individuality and
personality given to irrational animals shall succeed in attracting
the interest, and fixing the wandering thought of childhood, are all
questions rather to be answered by a trial of the book, than argued
in a preface.</p>

<p>We bring no cat and dog stories, no tales of monkey antics;
but we have endeavored to impress upon the little Heir of life,
in one of its highest forms, a comprehension of, and a reverence
for, life, even in some of its lower manifestations.</p>

<p>This object has already been kindly commended, and generously
welcomed, by no small number of skilled teachers and scientists,
who have given valuable time to the reading of manuscript and
proof of this series.</p>

<p>To those parents and teachers who will give the books a
careful trial, and reinforce these simple instructions by their
own enthusiasm and experience, the Nature Readers are commended
by</p>

<p>Do you know that there are cities on your path to
school, and under the trees in your garden? Do you
know that homes with many rooms in them hang in
the branches above your head? Do you know that
what you call “little bugs” hunt and fish, make paper,
saw wood, are masons and weavers, and feed and guard
and teach their little ones, much as your papa and
mamma take care of you? This sounds like a fairy
story, but it is a true fairy story.</p>

<p>In this book you will read of some of these wonders.
And when you have read this book well, you
shall have one or two more.</p>

<p>These books will not try to tell you all that there
is to tell of these things. They are only to wake up
your minds, so that you will think and study and
notice these things for yourselves.</p>

<p>Your eyes will be worth many times as much to you
as they now are, when you learn to observe with care
and to think about what you see.</p>

</figure>

<p>This is a picture of Mr. and Mrs. Crab.</p>

<p>Do you see the round hole?</p>

<p>It is the door of their house.</p>

<p>Mr. Crab lives in the sand by the sea-side.</p>

<p>He has a smooth, flat shell on his back.</p>

<p>The crab has eight legs and two hands.</p>

<p>One hand is large; the other hand is small.</p>

<p>He fights with the big hand, and takes his food
with the little hand, or with both hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Crab digs out his house in the sand. He makes a
place for a hall, a bed-room, and a pantry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crab does not dig.</p>

<p>Both her hands are small and weak.</p>

<p>She gets food to put into the pantry.</p>

<p>She never fights.</p>

<p>If she is in any trouble she runs home, or to a hole
in a rock.</p>

<p>See what queer eyes!</p>

<p>They are set on pegs; some call them stalks.</p>

<p>The crab can push the eye-pegs out and pull them in.</p>

<p>Would you not look odd if you could make your eyes
stand out six inches?</p>

<p>When crabs go into their houses, they draw down their
eyes and tuck in their feet.</p>

<p>Crabs are of many colors.</p>

<p>They are red, brown, green, yellow, and blue.</p>

<p>The claws are often of a very bright color.</p>

<p>The color on the shell is less bright; it is in small
dots.</p>

<p>The color on some kinds of crabs is in lines.</p>

<p>No crab is clear, bright red when it is alive.</p>

<p>When it is boiled it takes a fine, red hue.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>We cannot tell why the heat makes it change color.</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. CRAB AND HIS HOUSE.</p>


<p>The water of the sea comes and goes in tides.</p>

<p>Twice each day the water rises—then it is high tide.</p>

<p>After each high tide the water goes back—then it is
ebb tide.</p>

<p>Each tide lasts six hours.</p>

<p>When the snow melts in the spring, or when much
rain falls, the water rises high in the brook.</p>

<p>In the dry, hot days the water is low in the bed of
the stream.</p>

<p>If the stream or brook were full and low twice each
day, the change would be like the high and low
tides of the sea.</p>

<p>When the tide is low, Mr. Crab digs out his house.</p>

<p>He scoops out the sand with his big claw.</p>

<p>Then he folds his claw to carry the sand, as you can
carry grass or leaves on your arm.</p>

<p>Some kinds of crabs carry the sand in three of their
feet, bent to form a basket.</p>

<p>Mr. Crab takes the sand to the top of his hole.</p>

<p>Then, with a jerk, he throws the sand into a heap.</p>

<p>The crab is very strong.</p>

<p>He can lift and carry things larger than his body.</p>

</figure>


<p>He digs out a long hall.</p>

<p>He makes rooms in his house.</p>

<p>Then he goes with his wife to look for food.</p>

<p>They keep near their home.</p>

<p>They eat flies, gnats, ants, lady-birds, and other little
insects.</p>

<p>They also eat sea-weed.</p>

<p>When beach-flies light on the sand or on sea-weed,
the crabs jump at
them, and catch
them as cats catch
mice.</p>




<p>But the cats do not
move so quickly
as the crabs.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Crab put
the bugs they catch
into their pantry.</p>

<p>For six hours, while the
tide is high, they stay in their house; and while
they stay in the house they eat insects and sea-weed
they have stored away.</p>

<p>The crab acts as though he knew about the tide.</p>

<p>He knows when it will be high over his house.</p>

<p>He knows when it will be low, so that he can come out.</p>

<p>I could, for a year, tell you queer things about Mr.
Crab.</p>

<p>Where are your bones?</p>

<p>They are inside your body.</p>

<p>Your bones are a frame to hold up your soft flesh.</p>

<p>Mr. Crab’s bones are on the outside of his body.</p>

<p>His bones are his armor, to keep him from being hurt.</p>

<p>The crab can live and breathe either in water or on
land.</p>

<p>You can live only on land.</p>

<p>He can both walk and swim.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crab lays eggs.</p>

<p>A hen, you know, lays eggs, one by one, in a nest.</p>

<p>She keeps them warm till the chicks come out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The crab’s eggs are put in a long tube or sack.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crab does not leave them in a nest.</p>

<p>She carries them tied on her legs, or under her body.</p>

<p>When the small crabs come out of the eggs, they
grow very fast.</p>

<p>When you catch a crab by his arm or leg, if you
do not let go, he drops off this arm or leg, and
runs.</p>

<p>He will first pinch you, if he can, with his big claw.</p>

<p>Could you run with one leg gone?</p>

<p>The crab has legs to spare.</p>

<p>Then, too, his legs will grow again.</p>

<p>Yours would not.</p>

<p>A crab’s leg, or hand, will grow again very soon,
when one has been lost.</p>

<p>But if his eye-peg is cut off, it takes a whole year for
a new eye to grow.</p>

<p>I think he knows that; he is very careful of his eyes.</p>

<p>The eye-pegs of one kind of crab are very long.</p>

<p>He has a wide, flat shell.</p>

<p>There is a notch in each side of his shell.</p>

<p>He can let his eyes lie in that notch.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>How can he do that? His eye-pegs are so long he
can bend them down flat to the shell and keep
them safe in the notch.</p>

<p>Your skin is soft and fine.</p>

<p>As you grow more and more, your skin does not break.</p>

<p>Your skin gets larger as your body grows.</p>

<p>But Mr. Crab is in a hard shell.</p>

<p>The shell will not stretch.</p>

<p>It gets too tight, and what can Mr. Crab do then?</p>

<p>What do you do when your coat is too small?</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a strange thing.</p>

<p>When Mr. Crab finds that his shell is too small, he
takes it off, as you take off your coat.</p>

<p>He pulls his legs, his hands, and his back, out of his
shell.</p>

<p>He does that in his house.</p>

<p>You do not undress out of doors.</p>

<p>You go to your room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>So does Mr. Crab.</p>

<p>He slips out of his shell.</p>

<p>He pulls out his feet and hands, as if he took off his
boots and his gloves.</p>

<p>Then he is a poor, soft, cold thing.</p>

<p>But over all his body is spread a skin, soft as paste,
like glue and lime.</p>

<p>In a few days it gets hard.</p>

<p>It is as big as Mr. Crab, and just fits his shape.</p>

<p>It is a good, new shell!</p>

<p>It has the right colors,—blue, brown, red, or gold.</p>

<p>It has spots and rings.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Crab changes her shell, Mr. Crab stays
near, and tries to keep her from being hurt.</p>

<p>The young crabs have to change their shells often,
they grow so fast.</p>

<p>Crabs that live in dark mud have dark brown or green
shells.</p>

<p>Some crabs have sand-colored shells,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—pale gray or
brown shells, with close, fine specks like sand on
them.</p>

<p>There are more kinds of crabs than you could count.</p>

<p>They live in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>This book tells you of only a few of them.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">FREE FIGHT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The crab is quick to get cross.</p>

<p>Are you?</p>

<p>He likes to fight.</p>

<p>In that he is like a bad boy.</p>

<p>When he sees some other crab near his house, he is
angry.</p>

<p>Then he stands high on his toes.</p>

<p>He pulls in his eye-pegs, for fear they will be hurt.</p>

<p>He spreads out his big arm.</p>

<p>Now he is ready to fight!</p>

<p>He runs at his enemy!</p>

<p>Each tries to hit the other with his big claw.</p>

<p>This big claw, or hand, can cut and pinch hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes one crab cuts off the hand or leg of the
other crab.</p>

<p>Or he bites the shell on his back.</p>

<p>If only a leg is cut off, the crab may keep on fighting.</p>

<p>But if his hand, or eye, or back shell is hurt, he must
give up.</p>

<p>He runs home to hide, until a new eye, or hand, or
leg can grow.</p>

<p>If your hand is cut off, will it grow again?</p>

<p>When a crab is afraid, he runs home.</p>

<p>But he is very brave, and does not much fear other
crabs.</p>

<p>He fears birds most; for birds eat small crabs; and
the crab cannot fight a big bird.</p>

<p>Swing a rag over a crab’s head.</p>

<p>Up fly his eye-pegs!</p>

<p>Up comes his big hand!</p>

<p>There, he has caught the rag!</p>

<p>He will not let go.</p>

<p>You can lift him into the air by the rag; still he holds
on.</p>

<p>Once I saw a blue crab catch a dog’s tail.</p>

<p>The crab held on fast.</p>

<p>The dog gave yelps, and ran up and down the beach.</p>

<p>We had to catch the dog, and pry open the crab’s claw.</p>

<p>Let us look at this crab; he has let go the rag, and
has gone to dig in his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Lay this bit of shell on his hole.</p>

<p>See it shake!</p>

<p>He has run up and hit it with his head.</p>

<p>Now he waits.</p>

<p>Watch well.</p>

<p>There, the shell flies up in the air!</p>

<p>He struck it hard as he ran, and made it fly up.</p>

<p>I have seen him try twice, and make the shell shake
before he found how hard he must hit, to get
it out of the way.</p>

<p>Some folks think he shuts the door of his house with
his big hand.</p>

<p>I do not think so.</p>

<p>He knows that the tide will wash a lump of sand over
his hole, for a door.</p>

<p>The tide shuts him in.</p>

<p>He watches the waves come near.</p>

<p>At the last wave he jumps through his door, for he
knows the next wave will close it.</p>

<p>He never stays up one wave too long. He gets in
in time.</p>

<p>He is shut in his house with Mrs. Crab.</p>

<p>He knows that the tide will pass, and he has bugs to eat.</p>

<p>When Mr. Crab has lost a leg or hand, and a new one
grows, it is small at first.</p>

<p>Then when he gets a new coat, the new hand or leg
becomes half as large as the one he lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>The next new coat, the new hand or leg comes out
the full size it should be.</p>

<p>When crabs get a new shell we say they molt.</p>

<p class="ph3">MR. CRAB AND HIS FRIENDS.</p>


<p>The crab that has one large claw has many names.</p>

<p>Some call him the Fighting Crab, he is so cross.</p>

<p>Others name him the Calling Crab, because, when he
runs, he holds his big claw high, as if he called,
“Come! come!”</p>

<p>Most people call him the Fiddler Crab, and say that
his big claw is his fiddle.</p>

<p>I think that is the best name for him.</p>

<p>He can, and does, play a tune on that hand.</p>

<p>It is his violin, as well as his hand, his spade, and his
sword.</p>

<p>Do you see a row of little knobs on the inner edge of
his big claw?</p>

<p>He rubs those knobs on the edge of the shell that
covers his back, and the sound is his tune.</p>

<p>He uses that tune to call his mate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crab thinks it fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Crab has friends upon the beach, as well as down
deep in the sand and in the water.</p>

<p>When he walks along the sand, he meets big flies with
two wings.</p>

<p>He is glad to see them. Why?</p>

<p>They put their grubs, or young ones, in the sand, and
Mr. Crab knows that he can find them to eat.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_022" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">MR. CRAB AND HIS FRIENDS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Crab also meets a great, green tiger beetle.</p>

<p>He does not fight him.</p>

<p>He knows that he shall find the beetle’s grubs in the
sand and eat them.</p>

<p>While he is digging down below, he meets a little fat,
round crab, with big eyes, and a thin, gray shell.</p>

<p>He is glad to see him.</p>

<p>If the crab has not food enough to eat while the tide
is high, he will creep along in the sand, and catch
and kill this small crab for his dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Crab also meets, deep down, long worms, green,
red, or brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>They are making houses for themselves.</p>

<p>He does not trouble them.</p>

<p>Out in the sea, Mr. Crab finds some small shell-fish
called limpets.</p>

<p>He likes them so much that he lets them live on his
shell.</p>

<p>They take fast hold on his back, and he does not pull
them off.</p>

<p class="ph3">SOME OTHER CRABS.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<p>All crabs are not alike.</p>

<p>There are many kinds.</p>

<p>They differ in shape, color, and habits.</p>

<p>Some are not at all pretty.</p>

<p>Some are very pretty.</p>

<p>All are very queer.</p>

<p>The Spider Crab<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has long, thin legs.</p>

<p>The front of his shell, which is over his head, is not
wide, but is a sharp point.</p>

<p>This is to help him dig his way into sand and mud.</p>

<p>Some crabs do not make a house in the sand; they live
in holes in the rocks.</p>

<p>The Horse-Shoe Crab is of a chestnut color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Some call him the King Crab.</p>

<p>Look at his picture.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>His shell is of the shape of the hoof of a horse, but it
has a long tail, with sharp points on the edges.</p>

<p>The tail is as hard as wood, and has edges like a file.</p>

<p>The Horse-Shoe Crab lives in sand and in mud.</p>

<p>He chooses the muddy banks where rivers or streams
run into the sea.</p>

<p>He pushes his way in the mud, with his big, round shell,
and scrapes the mud out with his many feet.</p>

<p>He eats the worms he finds in the sand and mud.</p>

<p>Why are the worms down there?</p>

<p>Like Mr. Crab, they build a house in the mud.</p>

<p>Some time I will tell you about these worms.</p>

<p>Now and then, as Mr. Crab goes along under the ground,
he finds in his way a long, soft thing that looks
good to eat.</p>

<p>It is the long pipe or tube with which a clam takes his
food.</p>

<p>The King Crab puts out his claw to get it.</p>

<p>The King Crab can move his hand claw as quickly as
your cat can jump or strike out her paw.</p>

<p>But the clam is far more quick than the King Crab,
and shuts his shell down on the King Crab’s claw.</p>

<p>Now is he held fast, like a rat in a trap!</p>

<p>He waits to see if the clam will let go.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>
<p>No, he will not.</p>

<p>Then the crab drops off his claw, and goes away to
hide and grow a new one.</p>

<p>Do you see, in the picture, a crab in a shell made like
a curl?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>That crab steals his house.</p>

<p>He finds an empty shell, and goes into it to live.</p>

<p>It is odd to see him run, with the shell he stole on his
back.</p>

<p>How does he live?</p>

<p>By fishing.</p>

<p>All crabs hunt and fish.</p>

<p>I have told you how they hunt on the sand for bugs
and flies.</p>

<p>Did I not tell you how they hunt for grubs and worms
under ground?</p>

<p>How do they fish?</p>

<p>Mr. Crab gets into a good place to fish.</p>

<p>He pops out his eyes to see all about him.</p>

<p>Then when things that he likes to eat float by, he
strikes out with his big hand.</p>

<p>He catches what he wants nearly every time.</p>

<p>Crabs are very greedy.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">HE COMES OUT TO DIE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Do you wish to hear more about the crab that steals
his house?</p>

<p>Why does he do that?</p>

<p>His back is long and soft, and has no hard shell.</p>

<p>If he could find no hard cover, he could not live.</p>

<p>All the other crabs would bite or pinch him.</p>

<p>So would many fish.</p>

<p>He is called the Hermit Crab.</p>

<p>As the Hermit Crab grows too big for one shell, he
finds another.</p>

<p>He never stays outside of his shell until he knows
that he is about to die.</p>

<p>How does he know that?</p>

<p>I cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>But he comes out, lies flat down by his house, and dies.</p>

<p>He wants his house to live in, not to die in.</p>

<p>When he needs to change his shell-house, he hunts for
one to suit him.</p>

<p>Then he puts in his long claw, to feel if it is clean and
empty.</p>

<p>Now and then he finds another crab in it.</p>

<p>Then the two fight for it.</p>

<p>If some small thing lives in the shell which the hermit
wants, he pulls it out with his long claw.</p>

<p>Then he brings the new shell near, and springs from
the shell he is in to the shell he wants, as you
would spring from chair to chair.</p>

<p>On the end of his long, soft tail he has a hook.</p>

<p>He twists his soft body into the new shell.</p>

<p>Then he clasps his tail-hook to a small, round post
in the top of the curl of the shell.</p>

<p>That holds him fast.</p>

<p>His horny legs hang out in front.</p>

<p>He can run and carry the shell.</p>

<p>He can draw back into the shell and hide.</p>

<p>There is a small, pink, sea-animal, like a flower, that
one kind of crab likes.</p>

<p>He wants it to grow on his shell.</p>

<p>It may be that it helps him to catch food.</p>

<p>Or, it may be that he likes it to hide the door of
his shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>This pink sea-creature can build more shell on the edge
of the one the crab lives in.</p>

<p>This makes the shell larger.</p>

<p>Then the crab need not move so often.</p>

<p>When he moves, he takes his friend with him.</p>

<p>He puts out his claw and lifts her off his old shell,
and sets her on the edge of the new one.</p>

<p>Then he holds her there until she has made herself
fast.</p>

<p>Then he slips in, tail first.</p>

<p>The fine red, pink, and white frills of the friend hang
like a veil over his door.</p>

<p>They keep fish and other foes away.</p>

<p>For this pink thing can sting.</p>

<p>Once I found a nice shell.</p>

<p>I thought it was empty, and I kept it for eight or ten
days in a box. Then I laid it on a shelf.</p>

<p>One day I heard, clack! clack! clack!</p>

<p>And there was my shell running up and down the
shelf!</p>

<p>In the South Seas some of these crabs do not live in
sea shells.</p>

<p>They live in cocoa-nut shells. They eat the meat of
the nuts. When it is all eaten they seek for
another shell.</p>

<p>Each night these crabs crawl into the water to get wet.
They leave their eggs in the water to hatch.</p>

</figure>


<p>Crabs have many enemies. Fish and birds eat them.</p>

<p>Men eat some kinds of crabs. Crabs eat each other.</p>

<p>With so many enemies, crabs would soon be all gone,
if they did not lay so many eggs. Mrs. Crab, each
year, lays more eggs than you could count.</p>

<p>Crabs do not always have hard shells.</p>

<p>When they first come from the egg they have long
tails, four legs, and no claws. The crab’s body
then has a thin cover. He can swim well.</p>

<p>A little pink crab, named Pea Crab, goes to live in the
shell of the oyster. The oyster does not seem to
mind it.</p>

<p>You may see this little crab in your oyster soup. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
turns orange color when he is cooked. Pinna,
or Pea Crab has a very soft shell.</p>

<p>The Spider Crab has a brown shell, rough like
sand. Little thorns grow all over it.</p>

<p>This Spider Crab cuts off fine sea-weed with her little
sharp claws, and hangs it like ribbons on these
thorns or hooks.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Then she looks like a little green grove! Who can
tell why she does that? Is it to hide?</p>

<p>Do you see the wide hind feet of the crab in this
picture?</p>

<p>Those are his paddles, or oars. They are his swimming
feet.</p>

<p>His shell is wide and light. He can float on the waves
like a boat. He goes far out on the sea.</p>

<p>Some crabs can dig into the sand very fast.</p>

<p>They go in backwards. They slip out of sight like a
flash.</p>

<p>Or, they leave the tips of their heads and their eye-pegs
out, to look about. Sand-crabs do this.</p>

<p>Their shells are a pale brown or sand color. Their
shells are wide and round behind, and come to a
point in the front.</p>

<p>Their heads are in the narrow part of the shell. Their
shells are rough.</p>

<p>They are swift runners.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>Some hide in holes in the rocks. Some are sand-color,
and their color protects them.</p>

<p>When they are afraid, they lie flat on the sand, and it
is hard to see them. Some birds have long, thin
bills, with which to pick Mr. Crab out of his sand
house.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE USES OF CRABS.</p>


<p>How often does Mr. Crab get a new coat? His coat
does not wear out.</p>

<p>But it gets too small. Then he changes it to get a
larger one.</p>

<p>The baby grows fast. You seem to see it grow.</p>

<p>You grow fast. They say it is hard to keep you in
clothes.</p>

<p>You cannot wear the coat you had last year. But
your papa can wear his coat for many years.</p>

<p>He will tell you that he is done growing.</p>

<p>It is so with a crab.</p>

<p>When he is very young, he grows fast. He needs a
new shell very often.</p>

<p>When he is older, he grows more slowly. Then he
gets a new coat every spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>At last he does not grow any more. He keeps the
same shell,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> year after year.</p>

<p>It gets very hard and thick, and loses its bright color.
Very often it is nearly covered with limpets.</p>

<p>They fasten their flat or pointed shells to the crab’s
back, and stay there. I cannot tell you just how
long a crab lives.</p>

<p>Of what use is a crab? Have all things a use?</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_032" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">MR. CRAB HAS A PICNIC.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yes. God made all things; and all things are of use.</p>

<p>Sometimes we cannot find out the use. Crabs are good
for food.</p>

<p>Some kinds are eaten by men, as fish and oysters are
eaten. Birds eat a great many crabs.</p>

<p>Some birds almost live on them. Fish eat many crabs.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of crabs so small that you could
hardly see them. Fish feed on them.</p>

<p>Men catch and eat the fish. Crabs help to keep the
sea and the sea-shore clean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>Crabs are greedy. They eat nearly all kinds of dead
things that would spoil and make a bad smell
if left on the sand.</p>

<p>They eat dead fish, dead animals that are thrown into
the sea, and grubs, flies, and worms. Do you ever
see men going about to clean the streets?</p>

<p>The crabs help to keep clean the sea and the shore.
There are so many crabs, and they eat so much,
and so fast, that they can clean away much of
the dead stuff that lies on the shore.</p>

<p class="ph3">MRS. WASP AND HER HOME.</p>


<p>Here is a round hole on the hill-side path. Is it a
crab’s hole?</p>

<p>No, it is too far from the sea for a crab. Mrs. Wasp
made it for her baby to live in.</p>

<p>Her name is Vespa. In her house she has a hall, a
room, and a bed.</p>

<p>In the bed her baby lies asleep. It is now a soft, white
egg.</p>

<p>When the baby wasp comes out of the egg, he will be
all alone. When Mrs. Wasp has laid the egg
safe in bed, she goes away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>She shuts her door with a lump of mud. She leaves
her baby some food to eat.</p>

<p>The food is a pile of little caterpillars. When she
leaves her baby, she never comes back.</p>

<p>When he gets big, he digs his way out, and off he flies.
If he meets his mother he does not know her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp makes her bed of fine sawdust. She cuts
the wood up soft and fine.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">A WAY-SIDE HOME.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She has two small, sharp saws with which to cut the
wood. She can make paper.</p>

<p>She saws the wood into a fine dust. Then she mixes
it with glue from her mouth.</p>

<p>When she takes it home, she spreads it out thin with
her feet. It dries into fine, gray paper.</p>

<p>With it she papers her house, to keep her baby warm
and dry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp is cross, but she is wise. She has a long
sting. She kills, or puts into a deep sleep, the
caterpillars that she takes home.</p>

<p>She is never idle.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">A PAPER HOUSE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How does Mrs. Wasp make paper? First she finds a
piece of dry, old wood.</p>

<p>She cuts off bits of wood, like fine, soft threads. She
wets these with a kind of glue from her mouth,
and rolls them into a ball.</p>

<p>Then, she stands on her hind legs, and with her front
feet puts the ball between her jaws. She then
flies to her nest.</p>

<p>She uses her tongue, her jaws, and her feet, to spread
the ball out thin. On her hind legs she has flat
feet, to help her lay down the paper.</p>

<p>She lays one sheet of paper on the other, until it is
thick enough to make a nest. Some wasps hang
these paper nests in trees.</p>

<p>The nests are round, like balls, or are the shape of a
top. At the bottom of each you will find two
doors.</p>

<p>Some wasps make paste-board. The wasp that builds
in a tree does not live alone.</p>

<p>She has in her home very many paper rooms. They
are like cells in a honey-comb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>She can make wax. She puts a
wax lid on the cells.</p>

<p>She can make varnish, to keep the
cells dry.</p>

<p>One kind of wasp is a mason.</p>

<p>Her house is made of mud. She
brings mud in little balls, and
builds a house.</p>

<p>In the house, she puts a baby wasp.
She puts in little spiders for
him to eat.</p>

<p>A hornet is a kind of wasp. We
may call him Mrs. Wasp’s cousin.</p>

<p>Hornets catch and eat flies. There
is a black wasp that is called
a mud-dauber.</p>

<p>She builds a little mud house. I
know a boy who broke one of
these mud houses thirty-two
times.</p>

<p>The wasp built it up each time.
One of these mud-wasps built
a house ten times on a man’s
desk. Each time that he broke
it up, she built it again.</p>

<p>This kind of wasp does not leave her
baby alone.</p>

<p class="ph3">A LOOK AT MRS. WASP.</p>


<p>Mrs. Wasp’s color is blue-black. She has yellow marks.</p>

<p>She has four thin wings. Two are large and two are
small.</p>

<p>The front wings are the large ones. Her wings lie
close to her sides when her body is at rest.</p>

<p>The wasp looks as if she had two wings, not four.</p>

<p>The two under ones are hooked to the upper ones.</p>

<p>Her eyes are set close to her head. They are large.</p>

<p>They have a notch or dent in them. She has two
long wands, called feelers, on her head.</p>

<p>They are made in joints. She touches things with
them.</p>

<p>Her body is in three parts. The first part is the head,
with the eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>The next part is thick and short. The hind part is
long and slim.</p>

<p>These two join at a point. It looks as if the hind
part might drop off, but it never does.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp has a long, sharp sting in her tail.
The wasp’s sting is like two fine saws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>A drop of poison runs through it from a bag.</p>

<p>You need not fear Mrs. Wasp. She does not sting if
you let her alone.</p>

<p>She has six legs. The legs and wings are set on the
part of the body that is next the head.</p>

<p>She uses her front legs for hands. The body of the
wasp is hard, and made of rings like scales.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp uses her jaws to cut up wood for paper.
She does not need them to eat with.</p>

<p>She eats honey. When her baby eats spiders and
caterpillars, it does not chew them.</p>

<p>It sucks out their juice.</p>

<p>Wasps bite fruit and spoil it. They are cross, and fight.</p>

<p>They kill bees for their honey.</p>

<p>All wasps are not of the same color.</p>

<p>The wasp that leaves her baby alone is the hermit wasp.</p>

<p>There is a wasp of a rust-red color.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">ROOMS TO LET.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I will now tell you of a wasp that does not live alone.
This Mrs. Wasp takes good care of her babies.
She is called the social wasp.</p>

<p>While it is winter Mrs. Wasp hides. She does not
like the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Most wasps die in the winter. Only
a few live to come out in the
spring.</p>

<p>The first thing Mrs. Wasp does in the
spring is to build a new house.
She does not use an old house.</p>

<p>She puts her eggs into the house,
with some food.</p>

<p>When the young wasps grow up,
and come out, they help build.</p>

<p>More cells are put into the house. An
egg is laid in each cell.</p>

<p>The egg grows into a grub. The
wasps feed the grub.</p>

<p>They bring it honey. The baby wasp
has no wings nor feet.</p>

<p>It has to be shut up, to grow into a
true wasp. When the time comes,
the wasps put a wax lid upon the
cell.</p>

<p>At last the new wasp eats off the lid,
and comes out, a full-grown wasp.
Wasps work hard all the time.</p>

<p>They fly about for food, and for stuff
to make paper, wax, and varnish
and glue. They have homes to
build, and little wasps to rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>They seem to know they must nearly all die, when
frost comes. When the cold begins, the old wasps
look into the cells.</p>

<p>They kill all the eggs, grubs, and half-grown wasps that
they find there. Why do they do that?</p>

<p>Do they not seem to love the baby wasps? Yes.</p>

<p>They kill them quickly to keep them from dying of
hunger and cold. Is not that a queer way to
show love?</p>

<p>Some wise people do not feel sure that the wasps kill
the little ones in this way.</p>

<p>Do not forget that the wasp does not grow after it
gets its wings and leaves its cell. When it comes
out it is full grown.</p>

<p>When it is a fat, round, wingless grub it is called a
larva. When it has changed its shape, and has
wings, it is called a pupa.</p>

<p>Some call the pupa a nymph. Are those very hard
words?</p>

<p>There are many kinds of wasps. There are mud-wasps,
which make mud houses.</p>

<p>Lonely wasps build alone in the ground, and dig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
holes in the sand. They throw
the sand back between their
hind legs.</p>

<p>Did you ever see your dog dig a hole?
The wasp digs in the same way
as the dog.</p>

<p>Sand wasps make tiny earth houses
on walls and fences. Tree wasps
hang great paper houses upon
the branches or twigs of trees.</p>

<p>Rust-red wasps do not build houses
for their cells. They make fine
paper cells, and hang them with
the open part down, in some
safe place.</p>

<p>They varnish the cells to keep them
dry. In a cold land, the wasps
build in barns, attics, hollow
trees, or in the ground.</p>

<p>In warm lands, they hang a bunch
of cells out in the open air, on
trees or vines. One day I found
a wasp’s nest in an old tin can.</p>

<p>There had been paint in the can. The
wasp had made a stem of paint.</p>

<p>She used her feet to twist it into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
stiff rope. Upon that, for a stem, she built a nest
like a white flower.</p>

<p>She put a cell upon the stem, and six cells around that
one. In each cell was a wee, white egg.</p>

<p>The eggs grew to fat grubs. They had black heads.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Wasp fed them. She went from one cell to
the other, and fed her grubs, just as a bird feeds
its young.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wasp also makes a pap of bugs and fruit, and
gives it to her young.</p>

<p>Wasps are very neat. They keep their nests clean.
They use cells more than once.</p>

<p>But they make new nests each year. One kind of
wasp is called the White Face.</p>

<p>Every wasp has a clean, shining coat, and a fierce
look.</p>

<p>Wasps do not bite or chew food; they suck out the
juices of fruit and insects.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BEE AND THE MAN.</p>


<p>Did you ever see a hive of bees? Are you afraid of
bees? You need not be afraid of them.</p>

<p>They do not often sting those who let them alone.
There are some people whom bees never sting.
Do you see how small the bees are?</p>

<p>Do they not move very quickly? Are not their cells
very small? Now I will tell you a strange thing.</p>

<p>The man who knew most about bees was a blind man!
His name was Huber. He lost his sight when he
was a boy.</p>

<p>He loved to study. Most of all, he loved to study bees.</p>

<p>From a boy, he had a friend. She was a kind girl.
She, too, loved to study. When she grew up, she
became Huber’s wife.</p>

<p>Huber was not poor. He had a nice home of his own.
He had a man to live with him and wait on him.</p>

<p>Huber, and his wife, and the man, would go and sit
by the bee-hive. They read to Huber all the
books about bees that had then been made. Then
they would watch the bees, to see if they did the
things that were told in books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>When they saw the bees do other things, they told
Huber. Then they caught bees, and studied the
parts of their bodies. Ask your teacher what
kind of a glass they used<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to see the bee with.</p>

<p>The wife and the man told Huber all that they saw.
He thought it all over. They watched the bees,
year after year.</p>

<p>Huber worked fifteen years. Then he made a great
book on bees. He told his wife what to write.</p>

<p>He lived to be very old.</p>

<p>It is both from books, and by your own eyes and
thought, that you may learn these things. You
must watch if you would know. Give time and
work to this study.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW THE BEE IS MADE.</p>


<p>There are many kinds of bees. The chief of them all
is the hive bee. What does the hive bee make for
you to eat?</p>

<p>In each hive there are three kinds of bees. The queen
bee is the first. She rules all, and she is the
mother of all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<p>The queen bee does no work. She lays eggs in the cells.
The father bee is called the drone. He does no
work.</p>

<p>Who, then, builds so many fine cells? Who lays up
so much honey? Who feeds the baby bees?</p>

<p>The small, quiet, brown work bees do all that.</p>

<p>In each hive there is one queen bee to lay eggs.</p>

<p>And there are the drone bees, who hum and walk
about. And there are more than you can count,
of work bees, to do all that is done.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_046" style="max-width: 64em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">WORK AND PLAY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How does a bee grow?</p>

<p>Like the wasp, the bee is first an egg. Then it is a
grub, or a worm. Then, shut in a cell, it gets legs
and wings, and turns into a full grown bee.</p>

<p>The bee is formed of three parts, as a wasp is; but
the body is not so slim. The parts are put close
to each other. The bee has six legs, and four
wings, and many eyes set close like one.</p>

<p>The bee has many hairs on its legs and body. These
fine hairs are its velvet coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Part of the bee’s mouth is a long tongue.</p>

<p>It can roll this up: it uses it to get honey from flowers.</p>

<p>The body of the bee is made of rings. The drone
bee has a thick body, a round head, and no sting.</p>

<p>The queen bee has a long, slim body. Her wings are
small. She can sting: so can the work bee.</p>

<p>The work bee is not so large as the other two, but it
has large wings. The work bee must fly far for
food or wax. The queen bee stays at home.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XIX">LESSON XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE BEE AT HOME.</p>


<p>Let us look at a work bee. There are two kinds of
work bees. Nurse bees take care of the baby
bees.</p>

<p>The wax bees build the house. Let us look well at
the wax bee. See its body.</p>

<p>Here are the rings, and here are the scales of wax on
each ring. The wax is made in the bee from the
honey or sweet food that the bee eats.</p>

<p>In the bee’s body are two bags.</p>

<p>Into one bag it puts the honey that it gets from flowers.
It takes this home and puts it into the cells. What
goes into the other bag feeds the bee and makes wax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Look at this bee’s legs. On each leg is a basket, a
brush, and a tool with which to pinch and press
the wax into the cells.</p>

<p>When the bee goes into a flower, it gets covered with
dust. The brush on its legs takes off this dust
from the bee’s coat and puts it into the basket.
That dust is to feed the young bees.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_048" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">SWEETS TO THE SWEET.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the tool it strips the scale of wax from the
rings on its body. Then it takes the wax in its
mouth and lays it to build the wall of the cells.
Did you ever see a man lay brick on a wall?</p>

<p>The bee builds her walls very much as the man builds his.</p>

<p>When the work bees make cells, they first lay down a
thick sheet of wax. Then they build upon this
little wax boxes, each with six sides, set close to
each other. When the boxes are as deep as they
wish them to be, the bees fill them.</p>

<p>Let us see what they do with the cells. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
cells are for the dust, or food, called bee-bread.
Some cells are for the baby bees to lie in.</p>

<p>Some cells are for honey. The queen puts eggs in all
the cells that are for bees. The nurse bees put in
flower dust for the baby bees to eat.</p>

<p>The wax bees build the cells and get honey. The wax
bees have pockets for wax. The nurse bees have
only small pockets.</p>

<p>The queen bee and the drones have no pockets.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XX">LESSON XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE BEE BABIES.</p>


<p>A bee does not live more than three or four years.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The work bees know that some of the grubs must
grow to be queens, others to be drones and others
work bees. They make for the baby queen bee a
large, round cell.</p>

<p>In each hive there are five or six cells for these baby
queens. Then the nurse bees feed the grubs.
They give the baby queens all they can eat of
very nice food.</p>

<p>The baby work bees get only plain bee-bread. The work
babies are in small cells. The grub of the new
queen bee grows large, and eats as much as it wants.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>
<p>The grub of the work bee gets little food, and is then
shut in its tight cell, to turn into a bee. After
a time the grubs shut in the big cells turn into
queen bees. They begin to sing a song.</p>

<p>The queen bee hears it. She knows that more queen
bees will come out. That makes her angry.</p>

<p>She runs at the cells, to try to kill the new queens.
The work bees all stand in her way. They will
not let her kill the new queens.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_050" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">BATTLE ROYAL.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But there can be only one queen in a hive at one time.
So the old queen says, “Come! I will go away!
I will not live here any more!”</p>

<p>Many of the old bees say, “We will go with our queen.”
Then they fly out of the hive in a cloud. They
wish to find a new home.</p>

<p>Did you ever see bees swarm? They may fly far
away, or they may light near by.</p>

<p>They hang on a vine, or branch, or stick, like a bunch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of grapes. Can you put them into a new hive?
Yes.</p>

<p>Drop them softly into a new hive where there is a
piece of honey-comb. In a few hours they are
calm. Then they go to work.</p>

<p>The work bees begin to make cells. They spread wax.
They build walls.</p>

<p>If a young bee lays a bit of wax wrong, some old one
takes it up and lays it right.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<p>After the old queen goes out in a rage, what do the
rest of the bees do? They all keep still, but they
look to the cells where the new queens sing.
Then one new queen breaks off the lid of her cell
and comes out.</p>

<p>She lifts her head, spreads her wings, dries her legs.
Her legs are like gold. Her dress is velvet and
gold.</p>

<p>She is fine! The bees fan her and feed her. But just
then a cell near by opens, and out comes one
more new queen!</p>

<p>This will not do. Two queens do not live in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
hive. When the two queens see
each other, they rush together
and begin to fight.</p>

<p>If they stop the fight to rest, the work
bees make them keep on. At
last one of them stings the other
near the wing, and kills her.</p>

<p>Then this strong queen runs to the
other cells, where the baby queens
lie. She tears off the wax lids
and stings each new queen bee.
Then it dies.</p>

<p>Now the strong queen is the one true
queen of the hive. Her rage is
at an end. The bees come to her
and touch her.</p>

<p>They are proud of their fine, new
queen, and love her. They carry
out all the dead bees from the
hive, and in great joy build new
cells. The queen bee leaves the
hive but twice.</p>

<p>A few weeks after she is made queen,
the work bees let her go out once
into the sun and air. But her
wings are very small. She cannot
fly far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>She has no bag for dust. She does not need to get
honey. All she need do is to come home and lay
eggs.</p>

<p>She does not go out again until the next year. Then
she leads off a swarm of old bees, and leaves the
hive to the next new queen bee.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BEE’S WORK.</p>


<p>You know how the new queen bee is made and how she
lives. Now let us see how the work bee gets on.
The work bee in its small cell does not grow so
large as the queen bee.</p>

<p>But it has larger wings. When it is a true bee, it
pulls or breaks off the cap of its cell and comes
out. It is wet and cold and weak.</p>

<p>But near by is a cell, open, and full of honey. The
new bee takes a nice meal. Then it goes out of
the hive into the sun.</p>

<p>The other bees come to it, and touch it with their
feelers. They lick it with their tongues, to smooth
its brown coat, and help it to spread its wings.</p>

<p>Then off it goes to get honey and flower dust. It
knows how at once. It does not need to learn.</p>

<p>It finds its way. It knows the right flowers. It tries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
to keep out of the way of things that will hurt
it.</p>

<p>What color do the bees like best? They like blue best,
and red and purple next best. They like flowers
of a sweet smell, and all flowers that have honey.</p>

<p>They bring home dust of flowers, honey, and a kind
of gum. The gum is to line the cells and to help
make them strong.</p>

<p>If a queen bee dies, and all the baby queens are also
dead, what can the bees do?</p>

<p>They take a baby work bee and make a queen. Can
they not live if they have no queen? No, not
long, there will be no eggs laid.</p>

<p>How do they make a queen of a work bee? They pick
out a good grub. They put it into a round queen
cell.</p>

<p>They feed the work grub the queen food, or “royal
jelly.” When it grows up, it is not a work bee,
but is a queen.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE WISE BEES.</p>


<p>In the bee-hive all is not peace and joy. Foes come in
and try to kill the poor bees. Who are these foes?</p>

<p>A caterpillar may come into the hive to live. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
bees do not like him. He is not clean; he is in
their way.</p>

<p>Slugs also come in. Snails and moths also come to
steal the honey. When the foe is a small fly or
slug, the bees kill it and take it out.</p>

<p>But a large worm or slug they cannot take out. What
do they do then? They kill it, if they can, with
their stings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_055" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">A FOE AT THE GATE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then they build over it a tomb, or grave, of wax and
gum. That is to keep the bad smell of the bug
from the cells. If a snail comes in, they take
this same strong gum and glue him to the floor.</p>

<p>Then he must die in his shell. If a strange queen flies
in, they will not sting her.</p>

<p>But she must not stay. So the work bees form a ball
about her, until she dies for lack of air.</p>

<p>I have told you how wasps kill bees. Birds eat bees.</p>

<p>Some birds break into the hive to get honey. Bears
like honey. They break up wild bees’ nests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Hens and toads eat bees. Moths make the worst
trouble in bee-hives.</p>

<p>In June or July, the work bees kill all the drones.</p>

<p>They do not wish to feed them when it is cold.</p>

<p>Bees lay up honey to eat when the flowers are dead and
gone.</p>

<p>In the winter, bees sleep most of the time. They need
some food to eat when they rouse. As soon as
spring comes, they come out and go to work.</p>

<p>Do all bees build in hives? No. Wild bees like to
build in hollow trees.</p>

<p>In hot lands, some bees build in holes in the rock.
Swarms of bees that leave hives find odd places
to live in. I knew of a swarm that found a hole
in the roof of a house.</p>

<p>The bees got into the roof and lived there five years.
When a man took them out, they had two big
tubs full of comb. Is it not odd that bees can
make so much wax from their small wax-bags?</p>

<p>Did you ever find in the earth the nest of a humble-bee?
The humble-bee queen works. Humble-bees
dig holes in the earth with their front feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>When they have made a hall and a
room, they make a nest. It is of
grass, or leaves, or hay, cut fine.
They lay eggs in the nest.</p>

<p>They make honey in large combs.
The combs are more soft and
dark than those which the hive
bee makes. Field mice and moles
eat these bees and their combs.</p>

<p>One little bee, that lives alone, saws
out a nest in a post or tree. She
makes one room over the other.
In each she puts an egg and food.</p>

<p>She seals the door up with a paste
made of sawdust. Then she
goes off and dies. The next
spring out come the new bees.</p>

<p>They know how to get food and
make homes, just as the mother
did. One kind of bee makes a
house much like an ant-hill.
She makes a long hall.</p>

<p>From the hall she opens small rooms.
In each room she puts food, in a
ball like a pea. Then she lays
an egg by it, and leaves the
small bee to grow up alone.</p>

<p>One bee is called a mason bee. She takes fine mud or
clay, to make a cell. The cell is the shape of an
urn. Now and then, she builds this urn in an
empty snail shell.</p>

<p>One kind of the mason bees is of a dark green color.
Mason bees are very small. Some mason bees
live in holes in the ground. In the hole they
make a clay cell like a box.</p>

<p>But they are so neat that they do not like to see a
mud wall. What does the bee do to her wall?
She cuts out bits of nice, soft leaves, and lines her
cell! Some bees take bits of green leaves, as of
the plum tree.</p>

<p>But they like bright color best. One kind of bee lines
her cell with the petals of roses. When she has
glued them all over the cell, she then puts into
it some food and an egg.</p>

<p>Do you not think the new bee will like its gay, pink
cell? One kind of bee likes red poppy leaves
best. She cuts the bits of leaf quite small.</p>

<p>There is a bee in Brazil, which makes a large nest, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
a great bag. It is full of round
balls. The balls are full of
honey. The wax and honey of
this bee are of a dark color.</p>

<p>One kind of bee has no sting. Would
you like that bee best?</p>

<p>The tree bee is also called the wild
bee. This bee takes an old tree
with a hollow trunk. It cleans
out more and more of the old,
dead wood, and builds nice
combs.</p>

<p>A tall tree may be full of combs,
from root to top. In such a
tree, more than one swarm will
live and work. Each swarm
has its queen, and keeps in its
own place.</p>

<p>Smoke makes bees fall, as if dead.
People drive bees off with the
smoke from a fire of wood or
paper.</p>

<p>When I was a little girl, our bees
sometimes swarmed on the
fourth of July. I had to stay
home and watch them, and I
am sure I did not like that.</p>

<p class="ph3">MORE ABOUT BEES.</p>


<p>Would you like to own bees? Once I knew a boy
who had some bees. He kept them in a room,
at the top of his house. He left the window
open, and the bees came and went as they chose.</p>

<p>A swarm of bees costs about five dollars. Each year it
may gain for you five dollars, or more, by honey,
and a new swarm.</p>

<p>If you live in the city, you cannot so easily keep bees.
Why not?</p>

<p>They could not find the right food.</p>

<p>They need to fly in the field or in a garden, so that
they can get the honey and the yellow dust of
flowers. They need to fly where they can get the
thick gum from trees to line their cells.</p>

<p>If you have a hive of bees, you should learn to watch
them well. Like Huber, you may find out some
new things. We do not yet know all about bees.
We could learn more than is now known about
drones.</p>

<p>If you stand by a hive, the bees will not hurt you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
if you keep still, and do not get in their way to
the door as they go in and out.</p>

<p>Bees lay up for winter more honey than they need. So
the bee-keepers take out much of it to eat or to sell.</p>

<p>They must leave some for the bees. If too much
comb is taken out, the bees must be fed. You can
give them sugar or some sweet stuff. Bees like
flour made of peas.</p>

<p>They cannot feed young bees if they do not have sweet
dust or flour. They cannot make wax if they have
no sweet food. They cannot line their cells, nor seal
them well, if they have no strong gum from trees.</p>

<p>I know some people who think bees like to hear a
song, and so sit near the hives and sing to them.
But bees, really, love color, and sweet smell, and
nice tastes, and do not care much for any noise.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SPIDER AND HIS DRESS.</p>


<p>Flies, wasps, bees and ants are insects. Insects have
six legs, and their bodies have three parts. An
insect is at first a tiny egg. From the egg comes
a grub, and the grub turns to a full-grown wasp,
or fly, or bee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>When it first gets its legs and wings, and comes out
of its cell or case, it is as large as it ever will be.
Insects do not grow after they get wings. The
small fly does not grow to a big fly, nor the small
bee to a big bee. The first size they have when
they come out is the size that they keep.</p>

<p>The spider is an insect of another kind. It lays
eggs, and out of the eggs come little spiders.
They grow to be big ones. The spider changes
its size, it grows. It molts its skin.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_062" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">A CHAIN OF EVENTS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The body of the insect is hard, and is made in rings.
It cannot pull its coat off to get bigger, as a crab can.</p>

<p>The spider’s body is soft. Its skin is tough; it changes
its skin often when it is very young.</p>

<p>The spider has eight legs instead of six, and most
spiders have eight eyes. The spider’s body is in
two parts. The poison is not in a sting in the
tail. It is in the base of the two jaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>The spiders are somewhat like crabs; somewhat like
other insects, as the daddy-long-legs. The real
daddy-long-legs is a fly with long legs. A spider
that has just such legs is also called a daddy-long-legs.</p>

<p>The front part of the spider’s body is not so large as
the hind part. The front part has all the eight
legs and the head.</p>

<p>The spider has no wings, but he has two small front
legs, or hands, with five joints. He uses them
to feel with, and to take his food.</p>

<p>You will see on the head of the spider two short fangs.
They are its jaws. They have the poison in them.
They are used to bite.</p>

<p>The claws on the eight feet of a spider are very much
like a lion’s claw. The claws have a brush of
hairs on them.</p>

<p>The spider can walk up a wall. The brush on his feet
will not let him drop off. He uses his legs to jump
and to walk, and to guide his thread when he spins.</p>

<p>Spiders spin webs. The hind part of the spider is
large and round. It has six small, round tubes.
Each of these tubes is made of many very small
tubes. What are they for? They are to spin
this web. What is the web?</p>

<p>In the tube is a kind of glue. When it is drawn out
into the air, it gets hard. It is then a fine silk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and as it comes out it is woven into a net which
we call a web. All spiders spin webs.</p>

<p>Spiders are of all colors. Their dress is like velvet. It
is black, brown, red, and gold. It is in stripes and
spots. The spider is like a king in his rich dress.</p>

<p>The eight eyes of the spider cannot move. They are
set so that they can see every way at once.</p>

<p>While the spider is growing, he pulls off his dress as
Mr. Crab does. The crab’s bones are his coat.
The spider has no bones, but his skin is hard and
tough, and before the baby spiders are two months
old, they shed their coats three or four times.</p>

<p>We say they molt when they do this. They spin a
bit of line to take firm hold of. Then the skin on
the front part of the body first cracks open; then
after this the skin on the hind part falls off;
and by hard kicks they get their legs free.</p>

<p>The new skin is fine and soft but soon grows firm and
tough.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SPIDER AT HOME.</p>


<p>The spider, like the wasp, is busy all the time. It
is not cross like a wasp. The bite of a spider
does not do a man or a child much harm. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
spider does not bite
unless it is hurt, or
when it kills its
food. The bite is
to kill flies, bees,
wasps, ants, and
such things, to eat.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_065" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">IN HIS KINGDOM.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Spiders make webs,
nets, and snares.
They can spin,
weave, dig, hunt.
Some can build
rafts, and others make mud houses.</p>

<p>Their webs are to live or lie in.</p>

<p>The nests are for baby spiders. The snares are to catch
food. The silk of the web is very fine, but it is
very strong. It will hold up a big, fat spider.</p>

<p>It will hold fast a wasp or a bee. Do you see the
spider on his thread? It is his swing. He can
swing as the boy does in his rope swing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Do you see the spider lie at rest in his web? Do
you see the child rest in a web made of string?</p>

<p>How does the spider make his web?</p>

<p>First he finds a good place. He presses the end of
the tube he spins with, and makes a drop of glue
fast to a wall, or leaf, or stem. Then he drops
away; and as he goes, the glue spins out in
many fine streams, which unite into one, and turn
to silk-like thread. If he does not find a good
place to make his web fast, he can climb back!</p>

<p>How can he climb back? He runs up his line as fast
as he came down. If you scare him, he drops
down on his line like a flash. It will not break.</p>

<p>If you break it, he winds up the end quickly. Then
he runs off to find a new place to which to make it
fast.</p>

<p>The long lines in the web are called rays. The spider
spins the rays first. The rays are spread out like
the spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p>Webs are of many shapes. You often see the round
web.</p>

<p>The spider guides the lines with his feet as he spins.
He pulls each one to see if it is firm.</p>

<p>Then he spins a thread, round and round, from ray to
ray, until the web is done.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">TRAPS AND SNARES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The web of the spider is made of two kinds of silk.
The silk of the rays is smooth. The silk that
goes across the rays has tiny drops of glue on it.
This makes the line stick to the rays.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spider begins her lines at the outer edge. They
are laid nearer to each other as she gets to the
centre of the web. When all is done, she is in
the centre, and does not need to walk on her new
web. She has a nest near her web.</p>

<p>From the nest runs a line. Mrs. Spider can sit in the
door of her nest, and hold the line in her claw.
When a bug or fly goes on the web, the web shakes.
She feels her line move. She runs down the
line and gets the fly or bug, and takes it to her
nest to eat.</p>

<p>Before she takes the prey to her nest, she kills or
stuns it. Then she winds some fine web about
it. She makes a neat bundle of it, and then
carries it off.</p>

<p>You can make Mrs. Spider run down her line if you
shake the web a very little with a bit of grass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
or stick. She will run out to
see if she has caught a bee or a
fly.</p>

<p>The nest of the spider is made of
close, fine silk. It is like soft,
nice cloth.</p>

<p>In shape it is like a ball, or a horn,
or a basket. Each kind of
spider makes its web in the
shape it likes best. In the nest
the spider lays her eggs in a
silk ball. The eggs, at first,
are very soft. After a time
they grow harder.</p>

<p>More than two spiders never live
in a nest. Often a spider lives
all alone. Spiders are often
apt to bite off each other’s legs.
A spider can live and run when
half its legs are gone. But it
can get a fine new leg as a crab
can.</p>

<p>When the baby spiders come out of
the egg, they must be fed. The
mother takes good care of them.</p>

<p>They grow fast. When they are
grown, they go off and make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
their own webs. Sometimes the eggs are left in
the silk ball all winter. The baby spiders come
out in the spring.</p>

<p>Then the old ones are dead. But the young ones know
how to hunt and to spin. The very young spiders
do not have so rich a dress as the old ones. The
hairs of their coat are not so thick at first.</p>

<p>The soft, silk-like coat, with its rich color, is the only
beauty a spider has. People do not like his long
legs and his round, soft, bag-like body. Still,
some people who watch spiders learn to like them
very well.</p>

<p>Some people say that they hate spiders. Why do they
hate them? “Oh,” they say, “they are so very
greedy!” Well, a spider must eat a great deal, or
he cannot spin his web.</p>

<p>His food makes the glue that makes the web. Spiders
work hard. So they must eat much.</p>

<p>“But they bite.” They will not bite you if you do
not hurt them. If they do, the bite will do you
no harm. They bite insects to kill them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Do you not eat fish, meat, and birds?
Who kills this food for you?</p>

<p>“But the spider is not pretty.” True,
his shape is not pretty, nor are
his long hairy legs pretty. Just
see his fine black or gold coat!</p>

<p>If he is not pretty, he is wise and
busy. Webs are very pretty, if
spiders are not.</p>

<p>Spiders eat flies and all kinds of
small bugs. When a fly is fast
in a web, he hums loud from
fear.</p>

<p>The spider will eat dead birds. One
kind of spider kills small birds
to eat.</p>

<p>There is a spider that lives on water.
He knows how to build a raft.</p>

<p>He takes grass and bits of stick and
ties them up with his silk. On
this raft he sails out to catch
flies and bugs that skim over
the water.</p>

<p>There is a spider that lives in the
water. She can dive. Her nest
is like a ball. It shines like
silver. Her web is so thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
that it does not get wet. Her velvet coat keeps
her as dry as a fur coat. Her eggs are of the
color of gold.</p>

<p>When spiders eat, they do not chew their food: they
suck out the juice.</p>

<p>Spiders are very neat. They hate dust and soot.</p>

<p>They will not have a dirty web. If you put a bit of
dirt or leaf on the web, Mrs. Spider will go and
clean it off.</p>

<p>She shakes her web with her foot until all the lines
are clean. If the dirt will not shake from the
web, the spider will cut the piece out, and mend
the web with new lines.</p>

<p class="ph3">VERY QUEER SPIDERS.</p>


<p>I have told you of the spider that dives. I also told
you of the spider that makes a raft. The one
that makes the round web is the garden spider.</p>

<p>There is a spider that runs on water. How can she do
that? Have you seen boys dash about on ice with
skates on their feet? Did you ever see a man
walk on snow-shoes? This spider wears shoes.</p>

<p>They are shoes made for walking on the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
What are they like? They are like bags of air.
It is as if she had a wee toy-balloon on each of her
eight feet. She cannot sink.</p>

<p>There is one spider called a trap-door spider. She
lives in the ground. She digs a tube down, and
makes her nest deep in the earth.</p>

<p>Then she makes a door. It is a nice door at the top of
the hole. It has a hinge. It will open and shut.</p>

<p>It is like the lid of a box. How does she make this?
She spins a thick, round web. She fills it with
earth.</p>

<p>Then she folds the web over, to hold the dirt in. She
makes a hinge of web. This trap-door will open
and shut. It is firm and strong.</p>

<p>But the odd thing is, that the spider plants moss or
small ferns on this door! She digs the moss up,
sets it on her door, and it grows well. These
trap-door spiders eat ants and worms. When they
come out of their holes, they leave the door wide
open so that they can go back.</p>

<p>Once a man put a lady-bird at a spider’s trap-door.
She took it in to eat. She found it had too hard
a shell to bite. So she took it back and laid it
out by her door.</p>

<p>Then the man put a soft grub by the door, and the
spider took that to eat. She did not bring that
back. She ate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Spiders now and then eat other spiders, but not always.</p>

<p>One kind of spider makes a tent of leaves. She ties
the leaves down with silk. She lives in the tent
and keeps her eggs there.</p>

<p>One garden spider makes a nest in the shape of a pear.
One ties a little ball to stems of grass.</p>

<p>The young spiders have not their thick coats at first.
Small spiders will stay by their mother and sit
on her back. They act like the small chicks with
the hen. Most spiders live only one year. Some
live two. Some live over four.</p>

<p>There are some mason spiders. When a man is a
mason, what does he do? In what does he work?
There are mason wasps, and mason bees, and
mason worms. Mason spiders make a nest of
clay.</p>

<p>They take the clay in small bits and build a clay mug.
It is six inches long. They line it with thick silk.
The door is like a box lid. It has a hinge.</p>

<p>Some spiders are so small you can hardly see them.
One of the very wee ones is clear, bright red.
Some are very big.</p>

<p>The big ones are black, with spots and stripes, and
have thick coats like fur. If you could find a
tower spider, or a trap-door spider, and sit down
to watch it build or catch its food, I think you
would be happy for a whole day, or for many days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
The tower spider builds over her hole a neat tower
two or three inches high; she sits on her tower.</p>

<p>She has as many as fifty baby spiders at once. They
sit on her back for four or five weeks, until they
molt two or three times. They do not fight with
each other. When Mrs. Spider gets a fly or bug
for the little ones to eat, she crushes it, and the
baby spiders come and suck the juice, as she holds
the food for them.</p>

<p class="ph3">OUT OF HARM’S WAY.</p>


<p>By this time I am sure you think that all the small
bugs, flies, spiders, and crabs must soon be dead.</p>

<p>You have found how cold kills them. You have heard
how they kill each other. You know that men
and birds and beasts kill them.</p>

<p>How can any live? What is there to save the poor
things?</p>

<p>The two chief things that save them are their shape
and their color.</p>

<p>Why, how is that?</p>

<p>Let us see how this is done.</p>

<p>On the sand by the sea the crab that lives mostly out
in the air is of a gray color. It has fine red spots
like sand. The shell of this crab looks so like
sand that, if he lies flat and still, you can scarcely
see him.</p>

<p>The crab that lives on the sea-side mud is black-green
like the mud. Birds cannot see him very well, he
is so like the mud that he lies on.</p>

<p>The spiders that live in the woods are of much the
color of a dead leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Some of them, as they lie in their webs, fold up their
legs and look like a dead leaf. One spider puts a
row of dead leaves and moss all along her web.
She lies on this row, and looks like part of it.
Birds cannot see her, as she lies in this way.</p>

<p>One small bee that lives in trees is green, like a new
leaf. The bees, in brown, black, and gold, look
like parts of the flowers on which they alight.</p>

<p>Birds and beasts that live in snow lands, are often
white, as the polar bear and the eider duck.</p>

<p>Snakes that live on trees, or on the ground, are often
brown or green. They look like the limbs of trees.</p>

<p>Little lizards in walls are gray like stone. In woods,
they often are the color of a dead twig. These
things can fold up, or stretch out, and look like
twigs, or leaves, or balls of grass or hay.</p>

<p>All this will keep them from being seen by animals
that would kill them.</p>

<p>Some of them you know have hard shells to shield
them. Did I not once tell you how fast they
move? They dart and run and jump, quick as a
flash of light. That helps them to get out of the
way.</p>

<p>Did I not tell you, also, how the crab has his eyes set
on pegs? He can turn them every way to see
what is near him.</p>

<p>The insect and the spider do not have their eyes on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
long pegs. Some kinds have six or eight eyes.
These eyes are set in a bunch, and some face
one way, some another. They can see all ways
at once.</p>

<p>Then, too, so many small live things grow each
year, that they cannot all be put out of the way.</p>

<p>Each crab will lay more eggs then fifty hens. One
spider has more baby spiders than you can count.
One bee has more new bees in the hive each year
than there are people in a large city. In a wasp’s
big nest there are, no doubt, as many wasps as
there are leaves on a great tree.</p>

<p>Of the creatures which it is most easy to kill, very
many are made. And so, while many of them
perish each day, many are left to live.</p>

<p class="ph3">SHELL-FISH.</p>


<p>Have you not all heard the song, “Rock-a-by Baby
upon the Tree-top”? What babies live in tree-tops?
You will say, “Bird, wasp, bee, and spider
babies swing in the trees.”</p>

<p>Do you not know that there are small cradles that rock
all day long on the waves?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Up and down, in the sun, on the water, rock the cradles
of many shell-fish.</p>

<p>What are shell-fish?</p>

<p>They are soft animals that live in hard shells.</p>

<p>But you must know that these are not true fish. A
true fish is an animal that lives in the water,
and has a back-bone. The back-bone of a fish
is very much like your back-bone.</p>

<p>All fish can swim. Most of them have fins and scales.
Very many of them have long, slim, smooth bodies,
that will glide easily through the water.</p>

<p>All of you can see fish, in the ponds, lakes, or brooks
near your home. You often have them to eat on
your table.</p>

<p>If you live in the city, you can go to the place where
they sell fish and look at them.</p>

<p>In some other book I may tell you a little about the
true fishes.</p>

<p>In this book I shall now tell you a very little about
what are called “shell-fish.”</p>

<p>This is not a very good name for them, but we will use
it, because you will hear it from many people, and
will often see it used in books.</p>

<p>The right name for these shell-fish is a hard word,
which means “soft body” or “soft thing.” That
suits them very well, for they are all soft bodies,
they have no bones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>There are in the water soft-bodied things that have no
shells to cover them. In the next book we will
tell you of some of them.</p>

<p>These soft things that live in shells are mostly of a
round or a wedge shape. Their shells serve them
for houses to live in, for ships to sail in, for coats
to cover them, for bones to keep their soft bodies
in shape.</p>

<p>The shells of these soft things are of many forms.</p>

<p>Some are all in one piece, like a twist or curl. Some
have two parts, like the covers of a book. These
two parts are held by a hinge. And some shells
are made in many pieces or scales.</p>

<p>There are three kinds, or orders, of shell-fish. One
kind has a head on its foot. Another has a
head much like that of the snail. Still another
kind, or order, has no head at all!</p>

<p>Well! That is a queer thing, to have no head!</p>

<p>Let us learn first about the shell-fish with a head and
a foot.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of shell-fish of this order. They
differ in size, color, shape, and way of life. But
if we learn about one, we shall have an idea of all.</p>

<p>You know that the hermit crab steals a shell to live in.
It is often a long shell, like a curl. That is the
sort of shell that shell-fish with heads live in. It
is a shell all in one piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>These shells are very hard and thick. Why is that?
The fish in them is soft. It has no bones.</p>

<p>If these soft things had no hard shells, they could not
live. The waves would kill them. The crabs,
fish, and other animals in the sea, would eat them
at once.</p>

<p>Let us see how a shell-fish is made. The conch, or
winkle, is the largest shell-fish you will be likely
to find. His body is soft but tough. It runs to a
point.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_081" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">HEADS AND NO HEADS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That back part takes fast hold of the post in the shell,
so that Mr. Conch will not drop out. On one side
of his body he has a hook like a thumb. That is
to pull him back into his shell when he wishes to
hide.</p>

<p>The front end of the conch is wide and thick. Here
we find his mouth. Near his mouth he has two
feelers, such as insects have, to touch things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Where the feelers join his head he has two
eyes.</p>

<p>His foot is flat, and is as big as all the rest of his
body. It is just the size of the open part of his
shell. Why is that?</p>

<p>The shoe on his foot is hard, like horn. When he
draws back into his shell, that shoe is his door.
It fits close. It shuts him in safe in his shell.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXV">LESSON XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE STORY OF MR. CONCH.</p>


<p>The conch or winkle does not like to live in sand,
or on hard rock. He likes deep water, where he
has some sand and some rock. When the wind
blows, and the sea is very rough, he digs his stout
foot into the sand near a stone, and holds fast.
Then he will not drift on shore.</p>

<p>If he is cast on the shore, he will die. Mr. Conch cannot
live out of water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conch likes some soft sand for a bed for her
babes in their queer cradles.</p>

<p>What does Mr. Conch eat?</p>

<p>He eats other shell-fish. He likes to eat oysters. How
does he get them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>He goes off to the oyster beds.</p>

<p>He likes the nice young oysters. He picks one up with
his foot. You see he uses his foot for a hand as
well as for a door. He can spread his foot out
very wide. It is very, very strong.</p>

<p>When he has the oyster in his grip, he draws his foot
close, as you would shut your hand tight. That
breaks up the shell of the oyster. Then Mr. Conch
sucks up the oyster at his ease.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_083" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">CAST AWAY ON AN ISLAND.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The men who own oyster beds do not like him, for he
eats many oysters.</p>

<p>Mr. Conch lives a great many years. No one can hurt
him in his hard house, and he has all he wants
to eat.</p>

<p>His shell is the shape of a large pear. It has a little
point at the top, and a long end like a stem.
The stem end has a groove in it. His shell
has a turn or twist in it, three or four times
round. It is of a sand-color, or pale yellow, outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Some shells have dark stripes. Inside, the shell is
very smooth, and shines, and is of a fine, bright
red, or pink, or yellow. It is a very pretty shell.</p>

<p>How does the conch grow? The conch grows from an
egg. Most fish lay eggs. The eggs of the conch
are in a string. They are left lying on the sand
to grow.</p>

<p>What is the conch good for? In some places people
like them to eat. Fish and crabs eat the conchs’
eggs and the young conchs. The shells are made
into buttons and breast-pins.</p>

<p>The Indians used to make money from the pink part of
these shells. They also used the purple part of
the round clam shell for money.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">SEA-BABIES.</p>


<p>Now we must learn more about that string of eggs that
Mrs. Conch left on the sand. First it was like a
thread with knots tied close together on it. Then
it grew to be a yard long. It grew very fast.</p>

<p>The knots grew into little cases, or pockets. They
were set close to each other. At the two ends of
the string the cases were small, but after three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
four small ones, the others were of the size and
shape of big Lima beans.</p>

<p>Once I was out on the sand with a boy.</p>

<p>We found a string of this kind. It had been cast
up by the waves. It was of a pale straw-color,
and like a long curl.</p>

<p>The boy said, “It is a sea-weed.”</p>

<p>I said, “No.” Then he said, “It is some kind of a
bean or seed.” I said, “It is fish seed.” Let us
look at it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_085" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">OUT IN THE COLD.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each case, or pocket, is flat, and has a rim. The rim
has lines in it. In the front edge is a small,
round spot, where the case is very thin. This
is the door of the case.</p>

<p>The sides of the case are very tough. Let us cut one
case open. It is full of white gum, or jelly.</p>

<p>I see in it specks like grains of sand. Here is one
more string, far up on the sand. This one is dry,
hard, and light. The little thin places are real
holes now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The cases are quite empty. Here is one more string.
This, too, is light and dry. But the holes in front
are not open.</p>

<p>Shake it. Does it rattle? Yes. Cut a case open.</p>

<p>Why! Each case is full of wee shells! Each shell is
as small as a grain of rice! See how thin and
white these shells are.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="LESSON_XXXVII">LESSON XXXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">MORE ABOUT SEA-BABIES.</p>


<p>Now in these strings you have the whole story. First,
the tiny string Mrs. Conch left on the sand grew
to be a big string with large cases like these. The
small specks in it were to become shells, and the
jelly was to be the food of the baby conchs while
in the case. There are very many in each case.</p>

<p>They grew and grew. They ate up all the jelly.
They were true shell-fish, only very small. Then
it was time for them to go out.</p>

<p>They saw the thin skin over the small, round hole.
They felt sure that this was their door. They ate
off the thin skin, and went into the sea.</p>

<p>The conch lays its egg-strings from March to May.</p>

<p>It lays a great many. In the egg-case the baby shells
rock up and down, not on a tree, but on the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>This dry string, still full of shells, is one in which the
shells are all dead. It was cast on shore when
the little fish were too young to come out. That
made them all die.</p>

<p>These little things have a hard time to grow up. But if
they can live until they are of a good size, they
will have a thick shell. Then they will be out of
harm’s way, and will live a long time.</p>

<p>But how do these shell-fish grow? Do they pull off
their shells when they are too tight, as crabs do?</p>

<p>No. All these shell-fish wear a cloak, or veil. It is by
their cloak they grow. Why, how is that? This
cloak, or veil, is fine and thin. It is part of the
body of the fish, and folds all over it.</p>

<p>This fine cloak takes lime out of sea-water, and with
it builds more shell. As the animal needs more
room, it spreads out this veil over the edge of
the shell, and builds with it new shell. You can
see the little rims where the cloak built each new
piece. The color and the waved lines on the shell
are made by this veil.</p>

<p>So the shell-fish need not change his house. He just
builds on more room as he wants it.</p>

<p class="ph3">ABOUT MR. DRILL.</p>


<p>Here is a small shell-fish. He looks like Mr. Conch,
but is not so large. He is quite small. His
real size in the sea is not much larger than he is
in this picture. His name is Mr. Drill.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_088" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">THE LITTLE ROBBER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>His color is dark brown. His shell has ridges on it.
The body of the drill is dark green. It has a long
tail to twist round in its shell.</p>

<p>The drill does not live alone in a place by himself. A
whole host of them live near one another.</p>

<p>The very strangest thing about the drill is his tongue.
It is from his tongue that he gets his name.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a man use a file? With it he can
cut a hole in a piece of iron or stone. The tongue
of the drill is like a file. How is this tongue made?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>It is a little soft band that will move in any way, or
roll up, or push out. In this fine band are set
three rows of teeth. There are many teeth in
each row. The teeth are fine and as hard as the
point of a pin. We could not see them if we
did not use the glass that you were told of.</p>

<p>With this fine tongue the drill can cut or saw a hole in
a thick shell.</p>

<p>The drill is very greedy. He eats many kinds of shell-fish.
He likes best of all to eat the oyster.</p>

<p>How does he go to work? He cannot break the shell
of the oyster as the conch can. No. The way
he does is this.</p>

<p>With his tough foot he gets fast hold of the oyster-shell.
He picks out the thin, smooth spot called
the eye of the shell. Then he goes to work to
file his hole. It will take him a long time.</p>

<p>Some say it will take him two days. But he is not
lazy. He keeps fast hold and saws away. At
last the hole is made clear through the shell.</p>

<p>It is small, smooth, even; no man could make a neater
hole. Then he puts into the hole a long tube
which is on the end of his cloak or veil. He can
suck with that, and he sucks up the oyster till the
poor thing is all gone.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE STORY OF A WAR.</p>


<p>When the drill gets on the back of an oyster, what
can the oyster do? Nothing. The poor oyster
cannot help himself. Does he hear hour after hour
the file of the drill on his shell? Yes.</p>

<p>He knows the drill will get in and kill him, but all
that he can do is to keep still and wait.</p>

<p>The oyster is not the only kind of shell-fish that the
drill eats. When the drill goes after the poor
shell-fish that have no heads, he eats them at his
ease.</p>

<p>They cannot help themselves. They do not know
how to get away from Mr. Drill. The shell-fish
that have no heads live in shells made of two
parts, like the covers of a book. The two parts
are held to each other by a hinge.</p>

<p>It is a bad thing, it seems, to have no head. Without
a head who can take care of himself?</p>

<p>But let us see Mr. Drill try a fight with a shell-fish
that has a head. Now he meets his match!</p>

<p>He goes to the top of the shell. He makes fast, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
begins—file, file, file. The fish inside hears him.
“O, are you there, Mr. Drill?”</p>

<p>What do you think the shell-fish does? He draws
his body out of the way, and builds up a nice
little wall! So, when Mr. Drill gets his hole
made, and puts in his tongue—no fish, only a
hard wall! Then Mr. Drill also moves along.</p>

<p>He picks out a good place. Once more he goes to
work—file, file, file. “O, <i>here</i> you are, Mr.
Drill!” And the shell-fish with a head once more
pulls his body out of the way, and makes a new
wall.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_091" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">SEA-SIDE COTTAGES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then Mr. Drill has the same luck as before. Sometimes
he gets tired of the war and goes off. Now
and then, as he too has a head, he finds a spot
where there is no room for the wall. There he
makes his hole and sucks out the animal.</p>

<p>You will find very many of the shells on the sea-beach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
with these pin-holes in them. The holes were
made by Mr. Drill on his hunt for food.</p>

<p>But you will now and then find shells, as the thick
clam shell, full of holes, like a network. This
is not done by Mr. Drill.</p>

<p>Shells and bones are made of two kinds of stuff. One
is lime, which is hard like stone. The other is not
so hard; it is more like dry glue.</p>

<p>These shells with so many holes are old shells, long
dead, and the glue part has gone out of them.</p>

<p>How did it get out? It was bored out by a kind of
sponge. Only the lime part is left, like a fine net.</p>

<p>When bones or shells have only the lime part left,
they will break and crack like glass. If they
have too little lime, they will bend.</p>

<p>For all Mr. Drill has a head, he is not so wise as at
first he seemed to be.</p>

<p>He will sit down and make a hole in an old dead shell
where no fish lives. Now and then he makes
a hole in an old shell, long ago turned into
stone. He will spend two days on such a shell
as this!</p>

<p>Did you know that bones and shells and plants sometimes
turn to stone?</p>

<p>You will some day learn about that strange fact.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW SHELL-FISH FEED.</p>


<p>Do the shell-fish all feed on other shell-fish? Oh, no.
Some of them live on sea-weed. Some of them
live by fishing. They catch, from the water, small
bits of food, as small as grains of sand.</p>

<p>The shell-fish that live on sea-weed have a long, slim
tongue. It is somewhat like that of the drill.
The tongue is like a tiny strap.</p>

<p>The teeth are set on it, three or more in a row, like
the points of pins. As the teeth wear out from
work on the tough weed, more grow.</p>

<p>These shell-fish walk along on their one big foot.
First one side of the foot spreads out, and then
the other.</p>

<p>That pulls them along. Is it not very slow work?
But what of that? All they have to do is to
move about and find food.</p>

<p>They can take all day for it. They have no house to
build and no clothes to make.</p>

<p>They creep along to a good bed of sea-weed. Then
they put out the fine, file-like tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>It cuts off flakes of sea-weed for them to eat. They
are never tired of that one kind of food.</p>

<p>Even that queer limpet, who sits on a rock and has a
shell like a cap, has a head, and a foot, and a
tongue that is like a rasp. And he can walk
along the floor of the sea.</p>

<p>He can climb up the rocks. The limpet has his own
rock and his own hole in the rock. He goes back
to his rock when he has had all that he wants to
eat.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_094" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center">AT LOW TIDE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The world of the sea is as full of life as the world of
the land. There is one nice little shell-fish, about
as big as a pea. He lives in the sea-weed that
grows on rocks. He is brown, or green, or black,
or red, or dark yellow.</p>

<p>He can live in the damp weed in the hours when the
tide is out, and has left the rocks dry. He eats
sea-weed. Let us look at him. He has two little
feelers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>He has two wee, black eyes. He has a little snout, like
a tiny pig. At the end of this snout is his little
mouth. His small, dark foot has a dent in it.</p>

<p>He puts out his wee, file-like tongue, and laps it out
and in, as a dog does when he drinks water. The
